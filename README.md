# Grunt vs Gulp

This repo contains the demo code and files that was used to test Grunt vs Gulp for the article [Grunt vs Gulp: Battle of the Build Tools](https://deliciousbrains.com/grunt-vs-gulp-battle-build-tools/) on [deliciousbrains.com](https://deliciousbrains.com).

To get up and running make sure you have the Grunt and Gulp CLIs installed:

```
npm install -g grunt-cli gulp-cli
```

Then install the required packages:

```
npm install
```

Then run `grunt` or `gulp` as required.
